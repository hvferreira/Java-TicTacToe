## Prerequisites

+ Java 17

---

## Key Features of Solution

+ 2 players game
+ Board 3 x 3 squares
+ Players take turns putting markers on board
+ Goal is one of the players has 3 symbols in a row - Horizontal, Vertical or Diagonal
+ First player who gets the row wins the game

---

## Approaches

A player can choose between two symbols with his opponent, the usual game uses “X” and “O”.
The player that gets to play first will get the "X" mark (player 1) and the player that gets to play second will get the "O" mark (player 2).
Player 1 and 2 take turns making moves with Player 1 playing mark “X” and Player 2 playing mark “O”.
A player marks any of the 3x3 squares with his mark (“X” or “O”) and their aim is to create a straight line horizontally, vertically or diagonally with two intentions:
	a. One of the players gets three of his/her marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) i.e. that player wins the game.
	b. If no one can create a straight line with their own mark and all the positions on the board are occupied, then the game ends in a draw/tie.
